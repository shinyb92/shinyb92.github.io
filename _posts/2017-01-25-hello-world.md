title: Hello world! 
--- 

Hello world! My name is Alex Beaulieu. My friends call me Shiny. Welcome to my blog. It’s going to be the future home of many posts that I hope you’ll find useful, illuminating, and if I’m fortunate, funny!

What you can expect: 
	
	• Code/Tech explanations that Richard Feynman would be proud of. 
	• Literary/Scifi/Nerd references 
	• Real-life lessons/anecdotes from working on the web. 
	

A lot of code nowadays is shrouded, unfortunately, in mystery! It’s the equivalent of keeping the curtain closed during the Wizard of Oz. I want to be your Toto, in this scenario. The one pulling back the curtain to reveal the wizard pressing all the fancy buttons. 

If you’re interested in that kind of thing, stay tuned. And all of this comes with a caveat, if you can stomach it: 

I am not an expert *gasps!*. 

I admit that I self-taught all my programming abilities thus far. What I’ve learned in those two and a half years is that everyone self taught themselves how to code. It’s a constant learning process. 

In my defense, I went from an English Major interested in technology and healthcare, to a guy who is now self-employed as a freelance web developer and has been paid for those skills. 

Still, I want to make clear too that I don’t think I am ever qualified to speak about code in a super advanced Douglas Crockford-way. No way Jose. Here’s a link to Peter Norvig’s [great essay](http://norvig.com/21-days.html) on how learning to code or do anything can’t be learned in a few minutes/hours/days. This blog is not about easy, quick-to-learn code tutorials that offer limited wisdom. This blog is about clear instruction on complex topics, with clear examples that help me teach what I am learning to the rest of the world (which is a great way to teach yourself!). If you’re working on something similar and come across an issue you don’t understand, I want to be your little light, your Toto, your north star — whatever metaphor you choose. 

I hope you’ll join me. Thanks for reading :) You’re the best.
