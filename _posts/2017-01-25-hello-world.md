title: Hello world! 
--- 

Hello world! My name is Alex Beaulieu. My friends call me Shiny. Welcome to my blog. It’s going to be the future home of many posts that I hope you’ll find useful, illuminating, and if I’m fortunate, funny on the topics of web development, code, and the world that surrounds it. 

What you can expect: 
	
	• Code/Tech explanations that Richard Feynman would be proud of.
	• Blog posts on my favorite tools to increase productivity/code quality/development speeds. 
	• Literary/Scifi/Nerd references 
	• Real-life lessons/anecdotes from working on the web. 
	

A lot of code nowadays is shrouded, unfortunately, in mystery. It’s the equivalent of keeping the curtain closed during the Wizard of Oz. I want to be your Toto, in this scenario. The one pulling back the curtain to reveal the wizard pressing all the fancy buttons. 

If you’re interested in that kind of thing, stay tuned. And all of this comes with a caveat, if you can stomach it: 

I am not an expert. *Gasp*. I worked hard everyday to expand my knowledge (I'll get into a post about my tools for that in the future). But I'm not -- yet.  

I admit I am a self-taught programmer, though I've have massive help along the way. What I’ve learned in those two and a half years is that everyone teaches themselves how to code. It’s a constant learning process that takes constant practice. 

In my defense, I went from an English Major interested in technology and healthcare, to a guy who is now employed as a freelance web developer with a local agency and has been paid for those skills. 

Still, I want to make clear too that I don’t think that this blog is qualified to speak about code in an advanced Douglas Crockford-way that is intended to guide you through the perils of a particular language or framework quickly. No way Jose. Here’s a link to Peter Norvig’s [great essay](http://norvig.com/21-days.html) on how learning to code or do anything can’t be learned in a few minutes/hours/days and why that approach is bunk anyways. 

This blog is not about easy, quick-to-learn code tutorials that offer limited wisdom. This blog is about clear instruction on complex topics, with clear examples that help me teach what I am learning to the rest of the world (which is a great way to teach yourself!). If you’re working on something similar and come across an issue you don’t understand, I want to be your little light, your Toto, your north star — whatever metaphor you choose to help you along your way. 

I hope you’ll join me. Thanks for reading :)
